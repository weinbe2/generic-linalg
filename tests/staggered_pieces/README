This test verifies that the various staggered Dslash functions are working correctly.

* Compares the \gamma5 D function with applying D then \gamma_5.
* Compares the D^\dagger function with applying \gamma_5 then D then \gamma_5
* Compares summing applying D_{eo}, D_{oe}, and the mass term to applying D.
* Compares summing applying -D_{eo}D_{oe}, -D_{oe}D_{eo}, and the mass term squared to applying D^\dagger D.
* Compares inverting D directly with even-odd reconstruction.

To do: 
* Test building a chiral stencil (make 2^2 hypercube internal dof), perform a chirality reconstruction solve.
