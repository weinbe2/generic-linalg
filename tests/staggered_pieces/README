This test verifies that the various staggered Dslash functions are working correctly.

* Compares the \gamma5 D function with applying D then \gamma_5.
* Compares the D^\dagger function with applying \gamma_5 then D then \gamma_5
* Compares summing applying D_{eo}, D_{oe}, and the mass term to applying D.
* Compares summing applying -D_{eo}D_{oe}, -D_{oe}D_{eo}, and the mass term squared to applying D^\dagger D.
* Compares inverting D directly with even-odd reconstruction.
* Compares creating and applying a D stencil to the D function.
* Compares creating and applying a \gamma5 D stencil to the \gamma5 D function.
* Compares creating and applying a D^\dagger stencil to the D^\dagger function.
* Compares summing applying D_{eo}, D_{oe}, and the mass term via stencil to applying a D stencil.
* Compares applying a \gamma5 D stencil to applying a D stencil then a (-1)^coord function.
* Compares applying a D^\dagger stencil to applying a (-1)^coord function then D stencil then (-1)^coord function.
* Compares summing applying -D_{eo}D_{oe}, -D_{oe}D_{eo} via stencil, and the stencil shift term to applying D^\dagger D via stencils.
* Compares inverting a D stencil directly with even-odd stencil reconstruction.
* Compares applying a D stencil to applying a D stencil with the hypercube rotated into degrees of freedom.
* Compares applying a \gamma5 D stencil to performing a dof rotation, applying D_internal, applying \sigma3, undoing dof rotation.
* Compares applying a D^\dagger stencil to performing a dof rotation, applying \sigma3, D_internal, \sigma3, undoing dof rotation.
* Compares applying a D stencil to performing a dof rotation, summing applying D_{tb}, D_{bt}, and the mass, then undoing dof rotation.
* Compares summing applying an internal -D_{tb}D_{bt}, -D_{bt}D_{tb}, and the stencil shift term to applying D^\dagger D via stencils.
* Compares inverting a D_internal stencil directly with top-bottom stencil reconstruction.

To do: 
* Test building a chiral stencil (make 2^2 hypercube internal dof), perform a chirality reconstruction solve.
